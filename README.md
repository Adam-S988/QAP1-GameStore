1. Explain how your code meets clean code practices by using at least 3 examples of your own code. Screenshots should be used

  My code meets clean code practices but not including code that is not used, not including comments, my tests test key functions, the functions are small, and focus on a single responsibility, and not making the code more complicated than it needs to be.

2. Explain your project. What it does, how it works. Explain the test cases you used

  My project allows people to add games to a game store, view the game store, and then add games already in the game store to their own cart.
   

3. Outline the needed dependencies. Where did you get them from?

  I used the JUnit dependancy, which I got from a cloned repo from Jamie.
   

4. If you had any problems the QAP please explain what happened.

   My main problem with the QAP is that I struggle with Java. The concepts made perfect sense, and Jordan helped me to better understand what was going on.
